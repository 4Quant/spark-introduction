His research focuses on turning big hairy 3D images into simple, robust, reproducible numbers without resorting to black boxes or magic. In particular, as part of several collaborations, he is currently working on automatically segmenting full animal zebrafish images, characterizing rheology in 3D flows, and measuring viral infection dynamics in cell lines.\r\n\r\n## Learn more at \r\n- 4Quant: From Images to Statistics - http://www.4quant.com\r\n\r\n- Spark Demo from this presentation - https://gist.github.com/kmader/755c2d99c23f4cbe2e74\r\n- Setting up Spark on top of Sun Grid Engine - https://github.com/4Quant/sge_spark\r\n\r\n### Imaging\r\n- X-Ray Imaging Group at ETH Zurich - http://bit.ly/1gD8wKb\r\n- Quantitative Big Imaging Course at ETH Zurich - http://bit.ly/1kj9mnq\r\n- Presentation at Spark Summit 2014 - https://rawgit.com/4Quant/spark-summit-2014-presentation/master/ssPresentation.html\r\n\r\n### Graphs\r\n- FEM Demo on Gist - https://gist.github.com/kmader/6456262935af381c8dbe\r\n","google":"UA-48764461-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
